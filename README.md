# pongGame_clone
A clone of the popular pong game using Vanilla JS (Modules and Classes) and SCSS for the styling of the game and page components like the header and footer.

Still a work in progress, I'm yet to implement the start button functionality. 
Right now it only works on Desktop.

You can download the files and set up a local server to play. I hace yet to deploy the live site.
